# topo-for-DijkstraTest4Nodes.txt


# any empty lines and lines starting with '#' symbol is ignored
#
# The file should contain exactly two sections: router and link, each starting with the corresponding keyword
#
# router section defines topology nodes and their relative positions (e.g., to use in visualizer)
router

# each line in this section represents one router and should have the following data
# node	comment	yPos	xPos	SystemID
Node0	NA	3	1	0
Node1	NA	4	5	1
Node2	NA	2	3	2
Node3	NA	1	1	3
Node4	NA	1	6	4

# Note that `node` can be any string. It is possible to access to the node by name using Names::Find, see examples.

# link section defines point-to-point links between nodes and characteristics of these links
link

# Each line should be in the following format (only first two are required, the rest can be omitted)
# srcNode   dstNode     bandwidth   metric  delay   queue
# bandwidth: link bandwidth
# metric: routing metric
# delay:  link delay
# queue:  MaxPackets for transmission queue on the link (both directions)
